Lab Test 2 topics: If else and beyond 8 bits.

Sample Problems:

1. Check Even or Odd: Write an assembly program that takes an 8-bit number from the user and checks whether it is even or odd using the IF-ELSE structure.
2. Compare Three Numbers. Find Max and Min
3. Grade Classification. Above 80 is A+. 75 to 79 is A.......
4. Check if a Number is Positive or Negative
5. Nested if-else
6. Check if a triangle has all equal sides or two equal or none
7. Write an assembly program to add two 16-bit numbers stored in memory and store the result in AX. If 1234H and 5678H are added, the result should be 68ACH. If there is a carry, store it in DX.
8. Subtract 30 from 300
